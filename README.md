# agentic-workflows

Hi community, I just found an excellent library to work on AI agents. Will commit to this repository for sometime to experiment with the use-cases of these agents directing them to solve actual problems.

### A bit of history:
2 years back while browsing youtube, when I came across Indians selling courses about prompt engineering for 99â‚¹, I was well convinced that the concept prompting and creating something useful that solves real world problems is utterly a scam because these people used money as the center of attention towards prompt engineering. And cmon, how can something be so handy that you just tell a machine what to do, and, it will do it without efforts.

Until, I last week I came across [bolt.new](https://bolt.new). I used it, and was amazed by the beauty and simplicity of the output it gave:

This got me thinking, how in the world, something so powerful that it could eradicate jobs of frontend specialists, has already been created and people are still wondering why they're not getting responses for frontend roles they're applying to? Because obviously, they don't need frontend engineers anymore.
