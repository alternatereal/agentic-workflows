  "description": "LangGraph is a Python library for creating stateful, multi-agent applications with large language models (LLMs), designed to build agent and multi-agent workflows. It provides fine-grained control over agent applications' flow and state, offering features like memory persistence (storing conversation context) and human-in-the-loop workflows (allowing for interruptions and manual adjustments). LangGraph is inspired by Pregel and Apache Beam and is built on LangChain, though it can be used independently, which I aim to do with these experiments.",
